# Diagnostic settings

Status: planned

Send platform logs to Log Analytics as part of the pattern.

Portal equivalent: Resource > Diagnostic settings > Add

Use it when: After the resource and workspace exist.

This folder is a scaffold. Do not run `terraform apply` here yet. When it is implemented it will:

1. Call `shared/naming` so the name matches the WCC standard
2. Call `shared/tags` so tags are not forgotten
3. Expose `id`, `name` and `resource_group_name`

Until then, if you need this resource as part of an environment, say so on the pattern that should own it. The AI hackathon pattern already creates some of these inline.

See [Choose your path](../../../docs/choose-your-path.md).
