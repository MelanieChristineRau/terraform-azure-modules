# Function app

Status: planned

Includes a Flex Consumption path, not only classic plans.

Portal equivalent: Create Function App, storage, plan, identity

Use it when: HTTP APIs and event handlers.

This folder is a scaffold. Do not run `terraform apply` here yet. When it is implemented it will:

1. Call `shared/naming` so the name matches the WCC standard
2. Call `shared/tags` so tags are not forgotten
3. Expose `id`, `name` and `resource_group_name`

Until then, if you need this resource as part of an environment, say so on the pattern that should own it. The AI hackathon pattern already creates some of these inline.

See [Choose your path](../../../docs/choose-your-path.md).
