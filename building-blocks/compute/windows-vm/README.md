# Windows virtual machine

Status: planned

Same bundle as linux-vm for the WCC Windows estate.

Portal equivalent: Create Windows VM

Use it when: A Windows workload that is not a better fit for App Service.

This folder is a scaffold. Do not run `terraform apply` here yet. When it is implemented it will:

1. Call `shared/naming` so the name matches the WCC standard
2. Call `shared/tags` so tags are not forgotten
3. Expose `id`, `name` and `resource_group_name`

Until then, if you need this resource as part of an environment, say so on the pattern that should own it. The AI hackathon pattern already creates some of these inline.
