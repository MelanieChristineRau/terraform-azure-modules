# Route table

Status: planned

UDR for hub and spoke or forced tunnel.

Portal equivalent: Create route table, add routes, associate

Use it when: Spoke subnets that must not go direct to the internet.

This folder is a scaffold. Do not run `terraform apply` here yet. When it is implemented it will:

1. Call `shared/naming` so the name matches the WCC standard
2. Call `shared/tags` so tags are not forgotten
3. Expose `id`, `name` and `resource_group_name`

Until then, if you need this resource as part of an environment, say so on the pattern that should own it. The AI hackathon pattern already creates some of these inline.

See [Choose your path](../../../docs/choose-your-path.md).
