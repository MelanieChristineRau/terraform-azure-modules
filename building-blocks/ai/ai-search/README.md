# AI Search

Status: planned

Default SKU Basic. Do not use Free for a real RAG event.

Portal equivalent: Create Azure AI Search

Use it when: Hackathon RAG and document search.

This folder is a scaffold. Do not run `terraform apply` here yet. When it is implemented it will:

1. Call `shared/naming` so the name matches the WCC standard
2. Call `shared/tags` so tags are not forgotten
3. Expose `id`, `name` and `resource_group_name`

Until then, if you need this resource as part of an environment, say so on the pattern that should own it. The AI hackathon pattern already creates some of these inline.

See [Choose your path](../../../docs/choose-your-path.md).
